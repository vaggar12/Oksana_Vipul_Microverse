    <h2>History of Steve Jobs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1976</strong>: Wozniak designed and developed the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. That same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative supervisor Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) in the garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive.</li>
      <li><strong>1984</strong>: Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface) and conceived by early Apple employee Jef Raskin.</li>
